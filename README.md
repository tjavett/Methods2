Assignment: Earthquake Visualization and Data Elements

Good Morning class!

Today we are going to use data from the USGS to visualize serious earthquakes within the past year (2020). After visualizing the data, we will analyze the data to come up with insights about earthquakes and inspect the data that feeds into the visualization to learn about how the visualization is made.

Part I - Visualization

Step 1: Please visit the following website: [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/)

Step 2: Under Basic Options under magnitude please click 4.5+

Step 3: For Date and Time, please click custom. Underneath custom there should be a Start(UTC) and End(UTC). The start should be “2020-01-01 00:00:00”, the end should be “2020-12-31 23:59:59”.

Step 4: For Geographic Region click “Conterminous U.S.”.

Step 5 : Click “Draw Rectangle”. A map should pop up on the screen.

Step 6: Click “Use this Region”.

Step 7: Click “Search” under Output Options

Step 8 - Please zoom in on the map. It should be the “+” sign on your screen.

Step 9 – Press the button that looks like a key on your right.

**Question 1 - How many States had Earthquakes of 4.5 magnitude in 2020? (1 Point)**

**Question 2 – What the largest magnitude Earthquake and what state did it take place in? (There are two correct answers) Hint Use Sort After Generating Map (1 Points)**

**Question 3 – What state had the most Earthquakes in the year 2020? (1 Point)**

**Question 4 – Please google why the state with the most Earthquakes has the most Earthquakes historically. Please answer in 2-3 sentences. (2 Points)**

Part II – Inspecting Earthquake Data

Step 1 – Keep the original visualization in part 1 open and please visit the following website in a new window: [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/csv.php](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/csv.php). Here you will see the descriptions of the 22 categories of data beginning with the “time” category and ending with the “status” category. Read through the first 11 links briefly to understand the data.

Step 2 – Please see the spreadsheet below to see how the categories are aligned within the model.

The spreadsheet above represents the data that feeds into visualization we did in part 1 and includes 13 out of the 22 data categories the USGS tracks in this model.

Question 5 – Looking through the various data categories, what columns/categories do you believe were used to generate the map we saw in part one? What would these columns represent on the map? (2 Points) Hint – The map key is below:

Question 6 –Please look at the depth data category. [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/comcat/data-eventterms.php#depth](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/data/comcat/data-eventterms.php#depth)

Suppose you are a Geologist and you are trying to see what data points affect the magnitude of an Earthquake. You want to determine whether the depth of the Earthquake impacts the severity of the magnitude of the same quake. What could be a potential issue in using this category? Explain in 3-5 sentences. (3 Points)
